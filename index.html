	<h1>The Engagement</h1>
    <p>After dating for over three years, Michael bought a ring. Ashley knew something was up so Michael had to play it cool. On a beautiful Saturday afternoon, he took her to the Wind Caves. Once they got to the top, Michael got down on one knee, opened his backpack and pull out a... jacket. Ashley laughed. The rest of their hike Michael kept his cool.</p>
    <p> After the hike, Michael dropped Ashley off at her house. After a few minutes, Ashley heard a knock at the door. She answered it to find Michael, dressed in a suit, down on one knee with a ring.</p>
